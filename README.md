In the small town of *Willowby*, there stood an old library that was rumored to be enchanted. Every night at midnight, the books inside would whisper stories to each other, bringing their characters to life. One evening, **Sarah**, a curious 15-year-old book lover, decided to sneak into the library to see if the rumors were true.

As the clock struck twelve, the books began to rustle. To Sarah's amazement, characters stepped out of their pages. She met **Alice** from Wonderland, **the White Rabbit**, and even **pirates** from Treasure Island. They invited her to join their midnight council, where they discussed the tales of their adventures and the wisdom they contained.

Sarah spent the whole night listening and learning from the characters, promising to keep their secret. As dawn approached, they returned to their pages. Sarah left the library, inspired and filled with stories to tell, forever changed by the magic of the Midnight Library.


| Character |      Location     | 
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sarah     |   In the Library  |
| Alice     |   In the book     | 
| Animals   |   In the book     |

### Passage(Sentece be sentence TTS app)
1. What is this app about?
- This it a TTS app that reads one sentence by one from the passage.

2. How do we use this app in class.  
- This app is deployed on HuggingFace, so all you need is to simply access with the URL: [Passage](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KY7437/Passage)
- You can hear the passage sentence by sentence.    
- You can go on or go back using the two triangle-shaped button below.  

3. Advantage of this app?
- You can access this app through internet; students can use this tool wherever and whenever.   
- You can hear the passage sentence by sentence, as many times as you want.  
- You can convert the speed of the speech: 0.5, original, 1.5 and 2.0.  

4. Disadvantage or predictable problems of this app?
- This app offer only American accent English. 
- If students cannot use internet, they are inavailable to access this app. 
- Since this application is a TTS program, it may not be that effective to make sure for students to understand or comprehense the passage. 
- As this is just a TTS app, teachers cannot check who accessed or who didn't.   

5. How can we make up for those problems?
- When we tried to add more accents using google-cloud-texttospeech, it only resulted in error. So, if we really need any other accents like British, Austrailian, and Indian, we should use other applications or websites on online pages, such as ElevenLabs.   
- We can add videos or pictures to make it easier to understand.
