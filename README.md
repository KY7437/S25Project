In the small town of *Willowby*, there stood an old library that was rumored to be enchanted. Every night at midnight, the books inside would whisper stories to each other, bringing their characters to life. One evening, **Sarah**, a curious 15-year-old book lover, decided to sneak into the library to see if the rumors were true.

As the clock struck twelve, the books began to rustle. To Sarah's amazement, characters stepped out of their pages. She met **Alice** from Wonderland, **the White Rabbit**, and even **pirates** from Treasure Island. They invited her to join their midnight council, where they discussed the tales of their adventures and the wisdom they contained.

Sarah spent the whole night listening and learning from the characters, promising to keep their secret. As dawn approached, they returned to their pages. Sarah left the library, inspired and filled with stories to tell, forever changed by the magic of the Midnight Library.


| Character |      Location     | 
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sarah     |   In the Library  |
| Alice     |   In the book     | 
| Animals   |   In the book     |

## During the lecture
### Quizlet
1. What is this app about?
- This is a web-flashcard site, and it is a very efficient tool for memorizing words and phrases.   
- It offers you not only flashcards, but also other modes: exercise, test, and even game systems.   

2. How do we use this app in class?
- Teachers can make a class and lists of words or phrases within the website.   
- When the list is completed, the teacher can share its url link to students.   
- Students can access to the class and the lists uploaded in the class.   
- Students can use all the functions Quizlet offers.   

3. Advantage of this app?
- Neither the teacher nor the students have to pay extra money for just using Quizlet.   
- Anyone who has received the URL link can access to the class.  
- With teacher's account, the teacher can trace the students achievement.  
- We can use any vocabulary lists uploaded by other users. 
- We can use many kinds of lists; made by textbook publishers, or consisted of word-list books in the market(for free). 

4. Disadvantage or predictable problems of this app?
- There are more functions that we cannot use by using only free-version. 
- Ads.
- We cannot trust 100 per cent those unknown uploaders. 
- AI withing Quizlet helps the teacher not to enter wrong definitions, but sometimes there are wrong information like spelling error, ungrammatical sentence, or unpropriate sample sentences. 
- There is no report function that students can use; if there is any problem in it, students should tell their teacher. They cannot ask the original uploader if that list is made by someone else, not their teacher. 
- Quizlet is an online website, so if there is no internet connection, students cannot access to it. 

5. How can we make up for those problems?
- Quizlet has the function to make online list into a pdf file, so if there is no internet connection, we can give students printed ones. 
- It is best for teachers to make their word/phrase lists by themselves, and let students comment in any way. 
- If is helpful to check many dictionaries like Oxford Learner's Dictionary, Longman Dictionary, and Cambridge Dictionary.

### Passage(Sentece be sentence TTS app)
1. What is this app about?
- This it a TTS app that reads one sentence by one from the passage.

2. How do we use this app in class.  
- This app is deployed on HuggingFace, so all you need is to simply access with the URL: [Passage](https://huggingface.co/spaces/KY7437/Passage)
- You can hear the passage sentence by sentence.    
- You can go on or go back using the two triangle-shaped button below.

- You can hear the passage sentence by sentence, as many times as you want.  
- You can convert the speed of the speech: 0.5, original, 1.5 and 2.0.  

4. Disadvantage or predictable problems of this app?
- This app offer only American accent English. 
- If students cannot use internet, they are inavailable to access this app. 
- Since this application is a TTS program, it may not be that effective to make sure for students to understand or comprehense the passage. 
- As this is just a TTS app, teachers cannot check who accessed or who didn't.   

5. How can we make up for those problems?
- When we tried to add more accents using google-cloud-texttospeech, it only resulted in error. So, if we really need any other accents like British, Austrailian, and Indian, we should use other applications or websites on online pages, such as ElevenLabs.   
- We can add videos or pictures to make it easier to understand.
